**Discipline** is a personal time-management application that lets you track the time you have spent on your various activities throughout the day.

You can set budgets in hours and/or minutes for each activity. Currently, this feature is limited to budgets set on a per-day basis.

A chart graphic shows you how you spend your time; from what time to what time you usually do something, how many hours each day, and if you met or exceeded the alotted budgets.

At this time, this project is only meant to be a portfolio piece. While I use it myself and have offered it to friends, new users cannot automatically register themselves.

**If you are interested in a demonstration, I invite you to follow the instructions on the login page**.

I plan to dramatically expand the available functionality in the coming weeks. I continue to add more features and refactor the codebase.

I will open it to the general public once I feel the application is better secured and a bit more polished. **If you have any suggestions, comments, or inquiries, do not hesitate to contact me at kumar.ashwin[at]outlook.com**
