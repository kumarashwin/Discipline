A personal time-management project that allows users to log their time spent doing whichever activity. They can set time budgets on a per-day basis for these activities and then browse through infographics depicting how they spent their time; if they met or exceeded their budgets.

Under construction at the moment, but I should be finished with the initial release sometime very soon.
